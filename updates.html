Patch Notes - 1/1/2020
- @Anthony "Papa P" Perez's first patch! Added EMS Scuba uniforms - they only work if you change into them in the water so there is a changing point by Del Pierro Pier to assist in water recoveries in the area. These give you unlimited breath. As soon as you’re on land again, you’ll drop the tank. Although it seems if you ride a jetski over the clothing spot and get changed that it’ll persist so you can use that to get to other locations.
- Moved every single illegal location due to a severe case of meta. Apologies to anyone affected by this sudden change.
- Stanley is now gonna give you more money for your chopped parts.
- Due to a lot of people powergaming their injuries we’ve made Mythic Hospital (our injury script) treat you harsher.
- Cocaine no longer makes you pop an awkward squat to do a line
- Drugs are now farmed faster
- Removed weed seeds from the black market and the growing script has been disabled as its broken as fuck. Your weed seeds are useless if you have any.
- Nightstick has been moved to the black market as its illegal for civilians to have them
- New PD Map which features the first of some artwork by our community!
- New Jail Map which includes a lobby and cells. Visiting centre remains available to see prisons along with prison work. Visitors check in at reception while prisoners' go towards the front of the prison to go to the visiting room or to do prison work.
- Small update to Police Pings surrounding carjacking pings & the jewel robbery.
- Evidence locker has been added.
- Security cams have been changed to a tablet like system and type CCTV with the camera number to see the store etc. 
- Airplane license has been removed until the issue where it breaks your ID is resolved. Don't worry, those who are licensed to fly can still fly
