Patch notes 11/02/2020
- [Shelby] To help with @Law Enforcement robbery congestion, a new measure is in place - when a robbery of any kind begins a notification will appear to everyone currently in the server: 'OOC Message: A heist has begun. Do not attempt to start a store robbery or heist for the next 20 minutes. Do not attempt to attend the heist locations because you saw this message - that is metagaming.'
