Patch notes 11/02/20
- To help with @Law Enforcement robbery congestion, a new measure is in place - when a robbery of any kind begins a notification will appear to everyone currently in the server: 'OOC Message: A heist has begun. Do not attempt to start a store robbery or heist for the next 20 minutes. Do not attempt to attend the heist locations because you saw this message - that is metagaming.'
- Should the PD get notified that someone has started a robbery or heist in this time, they can use /ooc chat to tell the player to knock it off. 
- Players who do not respect this will be banned
- This will be integrated into our rules page on the website also
- For the vehicles that carry more then four people, seat switcher has been increased up to 8 seats. 
- Ever been a 4head and flipped your vehicle but because it was still in good condition you couldn't flip it back? Type /flipveh and you will now be able to flip you vehicle back on its wheels.
Ever wanted to be like TacoMan? well now you can! 
- Added TACO FAMER a taco shop near Kings Autos.
- Added TACOTIME! delivery services that operate out of Taco Farmer delivering tacos in taco vans.
- Added TACO THEIF You can also rob Taco Farmer for dirty money and sweet sweet tacos (fun fact - this is the only way to get tacos currently)
It's TacoTime!

- You should no longer have 0 <item>  in your storage inventory (home or workplace). The list will now only populate if you have 1 or more!

Patch Notes 09/02/20
- Most supercars, some sports classics based on supers, and some specific sports cars have been buffed. Handling is pretty much the same, but acceleration and top speed has been buffed. This should make supers more desirable and worth the money.

- Now if you rob the Pizza shop you'll steal more then just money.. Hope you're hungry

Patch Notes 08/02/2020 
- New PD speed radar for @Law Enforcement take We are one of about 10 server beta testing this radar for the developer and I already believe its ten times better then our current.

- Added bonus, it doesnt just appear now 24/7 :stuck_out_tongue:

Patch Notes: 3/2/2020
- Hand cuff items are now available at the black market. They 'soft cuff' your target when used from your inventory. 
- The target player can walk, get into a vehicle and out. They can't run, use their phones, etc.
- When cuffing someone, one handcuff item is used. When uncuffing, you receive the handcuff item.
- At this time, the handcuffs do not break and automatically release the target player (this is being worked on)
- Players are NOT to leave people abandoned in the middle of nowhere. (Why would you want to? Handcuffs are expensive!)
- An exception to this is if you knock the player out whilst EMS are online and they can call the EMS for help. 
- Hand cuff keys have been added to the PD, EMS and Black Market shops. 
- Upon being revived, target players are still cuffed. EMS and PD can then uncuff them.
- Hand cuff keys are multi-use. You can use one set of keys to uncuff as many people as you need to.
- The PD can't use their uncuff ability to uncuff civilian handcuffs - they need to use the keys.

- EMS Scuba gear wasn't working. Now it is

- Removed existing delivery mission system: We're moving away from this as its format is inflexible for editing on the fly and we want more variety. We'll be adding new delivery type missions in the coming weeks.. starting with

- @Anthony "Papa P" Perez Added Pizza delivery mission! You can find this at the new pizza shop MLO/interior in Vinewood - just go behind the counter to start delivering in a sweet custom pizza delivery vehicle! You can do this even if you have a normal job.

- Moved 'take away' food store from Horny's to the new pizza shop interior.

Patch Notes - 1/1/2020
- Anthony "Papa P" Perez's first patch! Added EMS Scuba uniforms - they only work if you change into them in the water so there is a changing point by Del Pierro Pier to assist in water recoveries in the area. These give you unlimited breath. As soon as you’re on land again, you’ll drop the tank. Although it seems if you ride a jetski over the clothing spot and get changed that it’ll persist so you can use that to get to other locations.
- Moved every single illegal location due to a severe case of meta. Apologies to anyone affected by this sudden change.
- Stanley is now gonna give you more money for your chopped parts.
- Due to a lot of people powergaming their injuries we’ve made Mythic Hospital (our injury script) treat you harsher.
- Cocaine no longer makes you pop an awkward squat to do a line
- Drugs are now farmed faster
- Removed weed seeds from the black market and the growing script has been disabled as its broken as fuck. Your weed seeds are useless if you have any.
- Nightstick has been moved to the black market as its illegal for civilians to have them
- New PD Map which features the first of some artwork by our community!
- New Jail Map which includes a lobby and cells. Visiting centre remains available to see prisons along with prison work. Visitors check in at reception while prisoners' go towards the front of the prison to go to the visiting room or to do prison work.
- Small update to Police Pings surrounding carjacking pings & the jewel robbery.
- Evidence locker has been added.
- Security cams have been changed to a tablet like system and type CCTV with the camera number to see the store etc. 
- Airplane license has been removed until the issue where it breaks your ID is resolved. Don't worry, those who are licensed to fly can still fly
