Patch Notes 12/02/2020

Patch notes 11/02/2020
- [Shelby] To help with @Law Enforcement robbery congestion, a new measure is in place - when a robbery of any kind begins a notification will appear to everyone currently in the server: 'OOC Message: A heist has begun. Do not attempt to start a store robbery or heist for the next 20 minutes. Do not attempt to attend the heist locations because you saw this message - that is metagaming.'
- [Shelby] Should the PD get notified that someone has started a robbery or heist in this time, they can use /ooc chat to tell the player to knock it off. 
- [Shelby] Players who do not respect this will be banned
- [Shelby] This will be integrated into our rules page on the website also
- [Pez] For the vehicles that carry more then four people, seat switcher has been increased up to 8 seats.

Patch Notes 09/02/2020
- [Salty] Most supercars, some sports classics based on supers, and some specific sports cars have been buffed. Handling is pretty much the same, but acceleration and top speed has been buffed. This should make supers more desirable and worth the money. 
- [Shelby] Now if you rob the Pizza shop you'll steal more then just money.. Hope you're hungry

Patch Notes 08/02/2020

Patch Notes 07/02/2020

- [Shelby] The clothing store near the unicorn is now robabble.
- [Shelby] The Pizza Shop is now robbable
- [Shelby] You no longer teleport into the car when you start a pizza job, you need to walk to it. This stops people robbing the place then teleporting into a getaway vehicle. Just don't get excited and hammer the E button otherwise you'll only get one car, but multiple fees. 
- [Shelby] When Police spawn their vehicles, they appear inside of them in the drivers seat. Boats included. Like a normal garage. Should help with Yacht response times!
- [Shelby] When EMS spawn their vehicles, they appear inside of them. Those jetskis included! Like a standard garage
- [Shelby] PD paychecks have been buffed: They're now the highest earning faction in the city.

- [Shelby] Store robberies have been buffed
- [Shelby] When you wash dirty money, you'll get $85 back instead of $80
  
Patch Notes 05/02/2020 
- [Shelby] No longer does the EMS revive reward fee come from nowhere - it comes right from your bank account.
- [Shelby] Thats right: You die and need to be revived? It'll cost you $2000
- [Shelby] Friend accidentally kills you? Might want to make them pay you back for it.
- [Shelby] Better start valuing those lives!
- [Shelby] Know a certain back alley doctor? They're charging the same, so you won't be able to circumvent this.

Patch Notes 03/02/2020
- [Shelby] Hand cuff items are now available at the black market. They 'soft cuff' your target when used from your inventory. 
- [Shelby] The target player can walk, get into a vehicle and out. They can't run, use their phones, etc.
- [Shelby] When cuffing someone, one handcuff item is used. When uncuffing, you receive the handcuff item.
- [Shelby] At this time, the handcuffs do not break and automatically release the target player (this is being worked on)
- [Shelby] Players are NOT to leave people abandoned in the middle of nowhere. (Why would you want to? Handcuffs are expensive!)
- [Shelby] An exception to this is if you knock the player out whilst EMS are online and they can call the EMS for help. 
- [Shelby] Hand cuff keys have been added to the PD, EMS and Black Market shops. 
- [Shelby] Upon being revived, target players are still cuffed. EMS and PD can then uncuff them.
- [Shelby] Hand cuff keys are multi-use. You can use one set of keys to uncuff as many people as you need to.
- [Shelby] The PD can't use their uncuff ability to uncuff civilian handcuffs - they need to use the keys.

- [Pez] Police Taurus has been replaced with one with working lights, please let me know if your stored one is missing extras etc as I can amend @Law Enforcement 
- [Pez] Also some small changes to the way Police vehicles handle EG, higher rank the car, the better the car.
- [Zombie] Removed existing delivery mission system: We're moving away from this as its format is inflexible for editing on the fly and we want more variety. We'll be adding new delivery type missions in the coming weeks.. starting with
- [Zombie] Added Pizza delivery mission! You can find this at the new pizza shop MLO/interior in Vinewood - just go behind the counter to start delivering in a sweet custom pizza delivery vehicle! You can do this even if you have a normal job.
- [Zombie] Moved 'take away' food store from Horny's to the new pizza shop interior.

Patch Notes 01/02/2020
- [Zombie] Added EMS Scuba uniforms - they only work if you change into them in the water so there is a changing point by Del Pierro Pier to assist in water recoveries in the area. These give you unlimited breath. As soon as you’re on land again, you’ll drop the tank. Although it seems if you ride a jetski over the clothing spot and get changed that it’ll persist so you can use that to get to other locations.
- [Shelby] Moved every single illegal location due to a severe case of meta. Apologies to anyone affected by this sudden change.
- [Shelby] Stanley is now gonna give you more money for your chopped parts.

- [Pez] Evidence locker has been added.
- [Pez] Security cams have been changed to a tablet like system and type CCTV with the camera number to see the store etc. 
- [Pez] Airplane license has been removed until the issue where it breaks your ID is resolved. Don't worry, those who are licensed to fly can still fly
