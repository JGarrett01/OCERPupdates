Patch Notes 22/02/2020
- [Shelby] As unveiled in game yesterday - a Cafe has opened in vinewood (Player run business) 
- [Shelby] It sells a few food and drink items including coffee which gives you a speed boost effect. 
- [Shelby] Doughnuts and iced coffee have been moved to the Cafe 
- [Shelby] The above will be given better hunger/thirst values as they'll be in a player run shop.
- [Pez] Map has been added at Sandy Shores Airport for tonight's event
- [Pez] Aircraft Garage has been removed for tonight's event
- [Pez] Car garage has been added near the petrol station next to the field for ease of car retrieval for tonight. 
- [Pez] As nobody had formally applied to take on the Taxi business, this has been removed from the server and all that relates to it. If you are still interested in taking on this business, please submit your business proposal.
- [Pez] Update to some of our map icons meaning less clutter and scroll list.

Patch Notes 19/02/2020
- [Shelby] Two new hairstyles for men that work well with the new 'hair overlays' as discussed above - #29, #34 in the barbershop
- [Shelby] One new hairstyle for women that overrides an unused custom hair that was bad. Find it at #64 in the barbershop
- [Shelby] Proper facial hair for men has been added. These actually fit in your 'mask' slot (and therefore need to be bought from the mask shop) find them at 90, 101 and 107 in the mask shop. More to come if these are well received. Some 'faces' may experience clipping issues with these - so they won't suit everyone. They look neat with the existing beards layered underneath for blending.
- [Shelby] Female accessory added (chain #88)
- [Shelby] two more overriding female hairstyles at slots #25 and #37
- [Zombie] Weapon damage has been rebalanced to prolong gunfights and make it so that shooting someone down is no longer as easy as it has been - as it takes more bullets then before and you're more likely to get into a proper gunfight rather then a one-hit-and-quit situation
- [Zombie] All guns do less damage (Excludes explosives & Blades)
- [Zombie] Using your fists, nightstick or torch to hit someone has been reduced - Punching someone is no longer a death sentence.
- [Shelby] Replaced two of our existing female custom hairs with better quality options. #27 and #44
- [Shelby] Replaced two of our existing male custom hairs with better quality options. #62 and #69
- [Shelby] Female denim overall dress added t-shirt #148
- [Shelby] Surgical masks added for Pillbox Medical Center. Scrub uniforms - also buyable from the mask shop #36
- [Shelby] Female top added, #120

Patch Notes 18/02/2020
- [Shelby] The 'Blemishes' section of the character creator now actually does something. It was a bug that it did nothing with the standard framework that I've now fixed.
- [Shelby] New female hairstyle, replacing an unused one. #75
- [Shelby] New 'tattoos'.. technically. I've unlocked vanilla GTAO's 'hair overlays' for your use - it'll help make a lot of hairstyles look nicer, and make some hairstyles not look like they're 'floating' off your head. They're found in several sections of the tattoo shop - all the way at the bottom of each 'part'. 

Patch Notes 16/02/2020
- [Shelby] Made the gap between doing a drug and the effect starting shorter
- [Shelby] Made Meth give you a 'scared' tweaker walk effect
- [Shelby] Fixed meth not having an animation
- [Shelby] Cocaine gives you a 'hurry' walk effect

- [Shelby] Black Market weapons are now more expensive
- [Shelby] You can farm drugs when cops are offline again!
- [Shelby] However, if you try to sell drugs when there are no cops it will be little to no profit for you

Patch Notes 13/02/2020

- [Shelby] New male hair - #63 - Long tied up dreadlocks
- [Shelby] 'New' Female clothing - #92 for skirts with stockings and #67 for non-denim shorts with socks. (These were already in the game, but clashing with a uniform, so they've been made available properly) Added some custom sock textures
- [Shelby] Two new 'water cloakrooms' added for EMS - Alamo Sea and Paleto bay (at the PD boat garages) for ocean rescues.
- [Pez] Radio prop has now been added when the radio is in your hand. So when you are adjusting your radio, you’re not just standing there. 
- [Pez] When you have your radio taken or stolen from you, you will now be removed from the radio channel you were in. So no more “hey guys my radio was stolen but I’m still talking to you on this channel even tho I don’t have a radio in my pocket”. 


Patch Notes 12/02/2020 
- [Pez] New emote (kinda). The torch has been passed, you can now use /dantelean to do...well...the Dante Carter lean. (Note, you can still use lean4, we just made an additional command for...memes)
- [Shelby] A new delivery job has been added. You deliver drugs as a courier.
- [Shelby] It's a secret location. So it may eventually move. So keep it secret!
- [Shelby] It pays in dirty dollars :D

Patch notes 11/02/2020
- [Shelby] To help with @Law Enforcement robbery congestion, a new measure is in place - when a robbery of any kind begins a notification will appear to everyone currently in the server: 'OOC Message: A heist has begun. Do not attempt to start a store robbery or heist for the next 20 minutes. Do not attempt to attend the heist locations because you saw this message - that is metagaming.'
- [Shelby] Should the PD get notified that someone has started a robbery or heist in this time, they can use /ooc chat to tell the player to knock it off. 
- [Shelby] Players who do not respect this will be banned
- [Shelby] This will be integrated into our rules page on the website also

Patch Notes 09/02/2020
- [Salty] Most supercars, some sports classics based on supers, and some specific sports cars have been buffed. Handling is pretty much the same, but acceleration and top speed has been buffed. This should make supers more desirable and worth the money. 
- [Shelby] Now if you rob the Pizza shop you'll steal more then just money.. Hope you're hungry

Patch Notes 08/02/2020 
- [Pez] New PD speed radar for @Law Enforcement take We are one of about 10 server beta testing this radar for the developer and I already believe its ten times better then our current.

Patch Notes 07/02/2020

- [Shelby] The clothing store near the unicorn is now robabble.
- [Shelby] The Pizza Shop is now robbable
- [Shelby] You no longer teleport into the car when you start a pizza job, you need to walk to it. This stops people robbing the place then teleporting into a getaway vehicle. Just don't get excited and hammer the E button otherwise you'll only get one car, but multiple fees. 
- [Shelby] When Police spawn their vehicles, they appear inside of them in the drivers seat. Boats included. Like a normal garage. Should help with Yacht response times!
- [Shelby] When EMS spawn their vehicles, they appear inside of them. Those jetskis included! Like a standard garage

Patch Notes 05/02/2020 
- [Shelby] No longer does the EMS revive reward fee come from nowhere - it comes right from your bank account.
- [Shelby] Thats right: You die and need to be revived? It'll cost you $2000
- [Shelby] Friend accidentally kills you? Might want to make them pay you back for it.
- [Shelby] Better start valuing those lives!
- [Shelby] Know a certain back alley doctor? They're charging the same, so you won't be able to circumvent this.

Patch Notes 03/02/2020
- [Shelby] Hand cuff items are now available at the black market. They 'soft cuff' your target when used from your inventory. 
- [Shelby] The target player can walk, get into a vehicle and out. They can't run, use their phones, etc.
- [Shelby] When cuffing someone, one handcuff item is used. When uncuffing, you receive the handcuff item.
- [Shelby] At this time, the handcuffs do not break and automatically release the target player (this is being worked on)
- [Shelby] Players are NOT to leave people abandoned in the middle of nowhere. (Why would you want to? Handcuffs are expensive!)
- [Shelby] An exception to this is if you knock the player out whilst EMS are online and they can call the EMS for help. 
- [Shelby] Hand cuff keys have been added to the PD, EMS and Black Market shops. 
- [Shelby] Upon being revived, target players are still cuffed. EMS and PD can then uncuff them.
- [Shelby] Hand cuff keys are multi-use. You can use one set of keys to uncuff as many people as you need to.
- [Shelby] The PD can't use their uncuff ability to uncuff civilian handcuffs - they need to use the keys.
- [Shelby] EMS Scuba gear wasn't working. Now it is
- [Pez] Police Taurus has been replaced with one with working lights, please let me know if your stored one is missing extras etc as I can amend @Law Enforcement 
- [Pez] Also some small changes to the way Police vehicles handle EG, higher rank the car, the better the car.
- [Zombie] Removed existing delivery mission system: We're moving away from this as its format is inflexible for editing on the fly and we want more variety. We'll be adding new delivery type missions in the coming weeks.. starting with
- [Zombie] Added Pizza delivery mission! You can find this at the new pizza shop MLO/interior in Vinewood - just go behind the counter to start delivering in a sweet custom pizza delivery vehicle! You can do this even if you have a normal job.
